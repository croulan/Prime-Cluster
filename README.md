# Prime-Cluster
Distributed prime cluster computation implemented with RPC 

The main() of the files is: 
    
    primeChk_client.c

 COMPILE:
  Make sure you're cd'd in the right directory and run: 

      make -f Makefile.primeChk 
  
 RUNNING:
  This program is dependent on rpcbind, a program not in stock Ubuntu 15.10.
  It it essentail that you are able to install and run the service which you
  can do so with the below command: 

      sudo apt-get install rpcbind
      rpcbind start

  rpcbind may notify you that another instacnce of if it is already running
  but should be okay.

  You should be able run the programs now which will require two terminals. 
  In one terminal run the command (server side):
      
      sudo ./primeChk_server 

  In the other terminal, run the command (client side) where the <num1> is a 
  number which you want to check is prime: 

      ./primeChk_client localhost <num1>
  

 DESCRIPTION: 
  This porgam demonstartes a distributive server/client architechure using 
  an RPC protocol which tells whether a number is prime or not. If a number 
  is less than ten thousand, then the computational load will be put soley
  on the server side. If above and equal to ten thousand, then the load will 
  be split in half betweent the client and the server where the client will
  get the lower half of the computation and the server will get the upper
  portion.


 NOTE: 
  Most of the code seen in the directory was auto generated by rpcgen, a linux
  command for streamlining rpc development of which I took advantage of. The 
  files that were created/edited by my work for this project were primeChk.x,
  primeChk_client.c, primeChk_server.c, and primeChk.h.
